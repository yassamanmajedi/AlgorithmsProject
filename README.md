# AlgorithmsProject

Mini-Project#1:
a. Implement Bubble sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort and
Merge Sort algorithms. Then create a file containing 10 million random integer
numbers in the range [−𝟐𝟑𝟐
, +𝟐𝟑𝟐], a file containing 10 million random double
numbers in the range [±𝟓 × 𝟏𝟎−𝟑𝟒𝟓
, ±𝟏. 𝟕 × 𝟏𝟎−𝟑𝟎𝟖], and also a text file containing
10 million random strings containing lowercase and uppercase English letters
with random lengths between 1 and 80 characters create. Then evaluate the
performance of your implemented algorithms on these three data files. It is
necessary to mention the runtime in milliseconds and the specifications of the
hardware used. Then repeat the same with the algorithms implemented in the
library of a programming language and compare the results with the algorithms
implemented by yourself. The choice of language and programming
environment is optional. Analyze the results and point out the strengths and
weaknesses of your algorithms.
b. What challenges would you face if you wanted to repeat the above experiment
with a billion numbers and a billion strings? Try to do this and report the results.
Important notice: Designing a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for
your project is mandatory.
Mini-Project#2:
a. Generate a data file containing all integer numbers in the range [0 - 10000000] in
a random order. Implement Counting Sort and Radix sort algorithms and sort the
mentioned file. Compare your results with the results obtained from Mini-
Project#1.
b. Repeat part a with numbers in the range [0-1000000000]. What challenges will
you face? Try to do this and report the results.
Important notice: Combine this Mini-Project with the Mini-Project#1in a unit
package. Modify the Graphical User Interface (GUI) appropriately.
